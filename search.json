An innovative chatbot designed to diagnose mental health issues such as social media addiction, social isolation, and cyberbullying, based on responses to a customized questionnaire.\n\n\n\nThe solution involved several key technical strategies:\n\nCustom Dataset Creation:\nLeveraged the Gemini and Google Bard models to generate a unique dataset simulating various mental health scenarios, facilitating the chatbot’s ability to provide personalized advice and support.\n\n\nModel Selection and Fine-Tuning:\nChose Mistral Instruct 7B for its robust capabilities, performing supervised fine-tuning with our custom dataset for enhanced specificity to mental health conditions.\n\n\nAdvanced Model Refinement:\nEmployed Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) within a Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, further aligning the chatbot’s responses with user needs. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques were utilized for efficient training on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\n\nDeployment Strategy:\nThe chatbot was deployed using Streamlit on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Virtual Machine (VM). To ensure global accessibility, firewall rules were modified, allowing users worldwide to interact with the Streamlit application seamlessly.\nThis comprehensive approach not only optimized the chatbot for accurately identifying and addressing users’ mental health challenges but also demonstrated a model for deploying AI-driven health support tools globally.",

The forecasting of stock prices ahead of time can help investors to generate more profits. However, the fluctuation of stock prices depends on many factors that are difficult to track manually. In this research, we propose the use of the long short-term network architecture to do effective forecasting of the NIFTY50 stock price index. We propose a hybrid model which uses a combination of 20 technical indicators and 13 global indices as the input variables. We then compare the performance of three long short-term memory networks with different input variables i.e. technical indicators, global indices and the combination of both. The performance of the three models is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error and r-squared error.\n\n\nPublication Link:\nHybridLSTM for NIFTY50 prediction using global indices and technical indicators",

To reduce the spread and impact of the pandemic (COVID virus), machine learning techniques can be used to diagnose and predict the disease using chest X-ray images. In this research, we present an approach using Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) to classify chest x-ray images into four classes, namely pandemic, SevereCOVID, Pneumonia and Normal. We present a comparative study between the performance of our Siamese network and other pre-trained CNN architectures i.e. VGG-16 and ResNet50 in this research. The model performance is tested by merging two publicly available datasets: COVID-Chest-Xray dataset and Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia). We achieved an accuracy of 98% on Siamese ResNet50 which gives the best performance in contrast to 95% on VGG-16, 93% on ResNet50 and 96% on Siamese VGG-16.\n\n\nPublication Link:\nSiamese Neural Networks for Pandemic Detection Using Chest Radiographs",

The goal was to accurately predict the NIFTY50 index’s movements by understanding its correlation with global market trends.\nAchieved the goal of delineating the NIFTY50 index’s responsiveness to global market trends, resulting in a research paper that was presented at an IEEE conference, highlighting the project’s success in combining AI with financial analysis to forecast market movements effectively.\n\nCode:\ngithub\n\n\nPublication Link:\nHybrid LSTM for NIFTY50 predictions",
